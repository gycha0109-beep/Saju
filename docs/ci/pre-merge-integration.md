# PR feedback and pre-merge integration

## Branch validation (2026-10-01)

- Admission/actual Git assembly/conservative selection regressions: 32 tests passed.
- Lint, typecheck and shared build passed.
- Changed-workflow actionlint passed except the specifically documented queue
  key unsupported by actionlint 1.7.12.
- Full Linux PR matrix, PIE and production-container checks are required on the
  exact submitted head. Live integration dispatch/queue, staged selection execution
  and simultaneous-load timing remain unverified until the guarded rollout.


Status: implementation proposed in this branch; production activation is not complete.

Work Track remains attribution. It never selects test coverage. Existing main
regressions, deployment workflows, required-check names and GitHub token write
permissions are unchanged.

## Execution

`ci-integration.yml` accepts an open, non-draft PR in this repository targeting
the default branch. Dispatch it on the exact PR head branch. It pins both the
head and current default-branch SHA, checks attribution before allocating the
full regression, merges that base into the checked-out head in isolated runners,
runs the existing CI as a reusable workflow, and rechecks head/base before
`CI Integration Verify` succeeds. A conflict or changed SHA fails closed.
No branch is pushed and no PR is merged by these scripts.

From an authenticated local checkout:

```powershell
node scripts/ci/request-integration.mjs OWNER/REPOSITORY PR_NUMBER
```

The command first requires every existing required check to succeed for the
exact head, with its configured GitHub App binding. It ignores only the new
integration check that it is about to request. Draft, fork, missing, queued,
failed, skipped, cancelled and newer-failed checks are not borrowed as success.

The whole integration workflow queues one regression at a time with
`queue: max` and `cancel-in-progress: false`. Up to 100 pending runs are supported;
a full queue cancels additional requests. Waiting runs do not hold a runner.
This is repository-scoped. It does not reserve a runner or enforce a shared
account-wide limit across producers. Stale requests fail admission and must be
resubmitted against a fresh head/base; arbitrary inflight deployments are not
cancelled. A duplicate manual request is still another run, so operators should
not repeatedly submit the same candidate.

## Activation and rollback

The repository variable `CI_STAGED_VERIFICATION` defaults to disabled. Deploy
and verify the integration workflow before enabling the staged path. New
workflow_dispatch files must first exist on the default branch, so their live
dispatch cannot be certified solely by this implementation PR.

1. Merge the reviewed workflow implementation and run an integration request.
2. Confirm its check is associated with the dispatched PR head, not main or
   another commit; verify successful, intentionally failed, conflicting and
   stale candidates and multiple queued requests in GitHub.
3. Add `CI Integration Verify` bound to GitHub Actions (App ID 15368) to main's
   existing required checks, retaining all current contexts. Require strict
   up-to-date checks; this is necessary to prevent a passed old-base candidate
   remaining mergeable after main advances. It may require PR branch updates.
4. Verify open PRs have current required evidence, then enable
   `CI_STAGED_VERIFICATION=true`. The PR workflow rejects this mode unless both
   the integration requirement and strict policy are visible through GitHub.
5. Before every merge, verify the exact current head/base, all required checks
   and mergeability. Existing main and deployment verification remain.

Rollback: disable the variable first to restore full PR regression where
applicable, verify that restoration, then remove only the added integration
requirement. Keep historical runs and all original required checks. These
steps change merge policy and require explicit authorization; the implementation
PR does not automatically perform them.

## Limits and acceptance

For staged PR selection, retain imported consumers, changed tests and static
file/SQL/fixture/process contract tests. Shared manifests, CI, public entrypoints,
production boundaries, data/document dependencies and unknown paths keep the
full regression. Main and integration candidates always run the full unit suite.
Ordinary leaf changes may be selected only after the integration gate is required.
MyeongHa already has conservative PR selection; its candidate additionally runs
all five DB suites and the authority core against the combined source.
Saju keeps all 16 shards; quality runs before them, required failure cancels
remaining shards, and at most four shards request runners per integration
candidate. Legacy full PR/main runs retain the previous parallelism of eight
until the staged policy is activated.
No implementation cancels a different PR or new head when an old candidate fails.

Governance, browser, production-container and PIE prerequisites retain their
existing required role. Those independent workflow definitions are not all
folded into this integration runner. PIE cancellation affects only stale
executions of the same PR and does not discard edited-body triggers.

Validate PR concurrency 1/3/6: required feedback latency, queue/start delay,
runner wall time, failed-candidate waste, stale request rejection and equality
of full-suite coverage. Repository-local serialization is a fairness/capacity
control, not a guarantee of shorter single-run time or fixed latency.
No simultaneous-load speedup is claimed before those measurements.

The local actionlint 1.7.12 does not recognize GitHub's documented
`concurrency.queue` key. Other changed-workflow checks must pass with only that
specific known diagnostic excluded. GitHub runtime acceptance of this dispatch
workflow remains mandatory during activation; this limitation is not a PASS.

## Architecture Check

Docs updated: yes. No new work tracks, aliases, application runtime modes or
alternate domain normalization. One CI-only rollout variable, one integration
request path, and one additional required-check contract are introduced here.
The guarded default retains existing PR regression until activation is verified.
No extra workflow write permissions, pull_request_target, personal project
seeding, production deployment change or administrator merge bypass is added.
